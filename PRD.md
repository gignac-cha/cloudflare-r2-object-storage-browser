#### 3.2.6 Folder Listing Cache (Priority: High)

**Cache Strategy**
- Cache folder contents in memory to avoid redundant API calls
- Cache invalidation on mutation operations (upload, delete, rename, move)
- Cache key format: `{accountId}:{bucketName}:{prefix}`
- Configurable TTL (time-to-live): Default 5 minutes

**User Experience Benefits**
- **Back Navigation**: When user navigates up to parent folder (Cmd+â†‘ or clicking breadcrumb), cached data loads instantly without API call
- **Forward Navigation**: When user navigates forward to previously visited folder, cached data displays immediately
- **Folder Switching**: Switching between recently visited folders in same bucket is instantaneous

**Cache Behavior**
- **Cache Hit**: Display cached data immediately, optionally refresh in background (soft refresh)
- **Cache Miss**: Fetch from API, store in cache for future use
- **Manual Refresh**: User can force refresh (Cmd+R) to bypass cache and fetch latest data
- **Auto-invalidation**: Cache entry invalidated when:
  - User uploads/deletes/renames objects in that folder
  - User creates/deletes subfolder
  - TTL expires (default 5 minutes)
  - User manually refreshes

**Cache Management**
- Max cache entries: 100 folders (LRU eviction policy)
- Max cache memory: 50MB (estimated, based on 500 objects Ã— 100 folders)
- Cache stored in-memory (not persisted across app restarts)
- Clear cache option in Preferences â†’ Advanced

**Implementation Details**
- Cache stored in ViewModel layer (FileListViewModel)
- Cache key includes: Account ID, Bucket name, Prefix (folder path)
- Cached data includes: Object list, common prefixes (subfolders), pagination tokens
- Background refresh: If cache age > 2 minutes, fetch fresh data in background and update silently
- Visual indicator: Show refresh icon in toolbar when background refresh is in progress

**User Preferences** (in Preferences â†’ Advanced)
- Enable folder cache: Checkbox (default: On)
- Cache TTL: Dropdown (1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, Never expire, default: 5 min)
